# AgilePixelTest-
Simple landing page developed for AgilePixel,
Could I have used a framework? Yes. 
Could I have used a CSS preprocessor? Also Yes, but again which one? Tailwind? Styled Components? SCSS? Too many to choose 
But I decided to just stick to the basics, no frameworks, no preprocessors.
Just pure HTML,CSS and vanilla JS.
