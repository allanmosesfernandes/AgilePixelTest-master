AgilePixel Test Project
This is a simple landing page developed for AgilePixel.

Project Details
For this project, I had the option to use various frameworks and CSS preprocessors, such as Tailwind, Styled Components, or SCSS. However, I made a deliberate choice to keep it simple and clean, using only pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

Why No Frameworks or Preprocessors?
By opting for the basics, I aimed to showcase my skills in raw front-end development. This decision allowed me to demonstrate my understanding of core web technologies and how to build a functional and visually appealing web page without relying on external libraries or tools.

Project Highlights
Clean and minimalist design
Responsive layout for a seamless user experience on different devices

Instructions
